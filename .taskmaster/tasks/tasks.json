MCP notifications completely broken - this is the highest priority fix\n2. save_config not implemented - prevents any persistence\n3. Tool prefixing missing - causes user confusion\n\nFOUNDATION IS SOLID:\n- HTTP server works reliably\n- Config parsing works correctly  \n- Ephemeral state management works\n- Core APIs respond properly\n\nREADY FOR IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:\nWith clear findings documented, we can now proceed to systematic fixes starting with the most critical blocking issues.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T08:42:09.510Z>",

Current implementation uses direct JSON serialization which, while functional, lacks protection against partial writes or system failures during save operations.\n\n**Recommended Atomic Strategy:**\n1. Write configuration data to temporary file (servers-config.json.tmp)\n2. Perform validation on temporary file content\n3. Use atomic rename operation to replace original file\n4. Implement cleanup of temporary files on failure\n\n**Additional Enhancements to Consider:**\n- File locking mechanism for concurrent access protection\n- Automatic backup creation before config changes\n- Rollback capability if validation fails\n- Checksum verification for data integrity\n\n**Implementation Priority:** Medium - current direct write approach works for single-instance usage but atomic strategy would provide better reliability and safety guarantees for production environments.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T18:38:14.643Z>",

Combined context format: '{project_path}' or '{project_path}+{user_id}'.\n\nFile storage utilizes ~/.mcp-bridge-proxy/contexts/ directory with {hash_of_context}.json filenames for filesystem safety. Each context file stores per-context tool enable/disable preferences.\n\nContext file structure includes context_id (hashed identifier), project_path (absolute path), user_id (optional), enabled_tools (hash map by server name), and disabled_tools (hash map by server name).\n\nContext resolution process: extract project_dir from --project-dir argument, extract optional user_id from HTTP headers or startup config, generate context_key combining project_dir and user_id, hash context_key for safe filename, then load or create context file.\n\nIntegration requires merging context preferences with servers-config.json during tool list generation, updating context files on enable_tool/disable_tool operations, and implementing thread-safe file access for concurrent operations.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T19:34:20.886Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-27T19:39:05.258Z>\n**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**\n\nSuccessfully implemented complete file-based user configuration system with context isolation. Created src/context.rs module containing ContextConfig struct with all required fields (context_id, project_path, user_id, client_type, enabled_tools, disabled_tools). Implemented SHA256 hashing for safe filename generation and context file management in ~/.mcp-bridge-proxy/contexts/ directory.\n\nContextManager provides automatic home directory detection, context directory creation, and thread-safe file operations with JSON serialization. Includes context cleanup functionality for inactive contexts older than 30 days.\n\nIntegrated ContextManager into BridgeState with context-aware tool filtering in discover_and_enable_tools function. Modified enable_tool/disable_tool operations to persist preferences to user context files. Tool status reporting now reflects context-specific preferences.\n\nAdded required dependencies: sha2 for context key hashing and dirs for home directory detection.\n\nSystem provides project-based context isolation where different projects maintain separate tool preferences. Tool preferences persist across sessions with graceful fallback to config defaults when no context preference exists.\n\nImplementation ready for testing with current project-based isolation.

        "details": "This task addresses critical findings from debugging session that revealed tool filtering is completely broken in the multi-project context isolation system. While context loading works correctly (unique context IDs, proper working directory headers, correct context file creation), the tools/list handler ignores context-specific configurations and returns identical tool lists for all projects.\n\n**Core Issues to Fix:**\n\n1. **Tool Filtering Handler Redesign**: \n   - Modify tools/list handler to use context-specific enabled_tools instead of global self.enabled_tools\n   - Implement proper context lookup based on request headers (working directory + optional user_id)\n   - Ensure context-specific enabled/disabled tool states are respected during tool list generation\n\n2. **Architecture Separation**:\n   - Separate system-level configuration (server startup, available servers) from user-level configuration (tool visibility per context)\n   - System config should define which MCP servers to start and make available\n   - User/context config should control which tools are visible/enabled for each project context\n   - Resolve chicken-and-egg problem where current system tries to use user contexts for server startup decisions\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Extract context identification logic into reusable function (project path + user_id hashing)\n   - Modify tools/list endpoint to load context-specific configuration before filtering tools\n   - Update tool filtering logic to check context.enabled_tools map instead of global state\n   - Implement default behavior: start all configured servers but default all tools to disabled state\n   - Add debug logging for context-based tool filtering to verify correct operation\n\n4. **Configuration Structure Changes**:\n   - System config (~/.mcp-bridge-proxy/servers-config.json): defines available MCP servers\n   - Context config (~/.mcp-bridge-proxy/contexts/{hash}.json): stores per-project tool enable/disable state\n   - Ensure context configs are created with all tools disabled by default when new contexts are detected\n\n**Debug Evidence Integration**:\n- Context loading debug logs confirm correct project paths and context ID generation\n- Tool filtering debug logs are missing (code path never reached) - this will be fixed\n- Both projects currently return identical 15-tool lists despite different context configurations",
        "testStrategy": "Comprehensive testing strategy to verify tool filtering fix:\n\n1. **Context Isolation Verification**:\n   - Set up two different projects with different working directories\n   - Configure different tool enable/disable states in each project's context\n   - Verify tools/list returns different tool lists for each project context\n   - Confirm context IDs are correctly generated and used for tool filtering\n\n2. **Tool Filtering Logic Testing**:\n   - Enable specific tools in project A context, disable in project B context\n   - Call tools/list from each project and verify only enabled tools appear\n   - Test edge cases: all tools disabled, all tools enabled, mixed states\n   - Verify global tool list vs context-filtered tool list behavior\n\n3. **Debug Logging Validation**:\n   - Enable debug logging for context-based tool filtering\n   - Verify debug logs appear showing context lookup and tool filtering decisions\n   - Confirm context-specific enabled_tools map is being used instead of global state\n   - Check that working directory headers are properly processed for context identification\n\n4. **Architecture Separation Testing**:\n   - Verify system starts all configured MCP servers regardless of user context states\n   - Test that new contexts default to all tools disabled\n   - Confirm system-level server availability vs user-level tool visibility separation\n   - Test server startup independence from user context configurations\n\n5. **Regression Testing**:\n   - Verify existing functionality still works: enable_tool, disable_tool, save_config\n   - Test that context switching works correctly when changing between projects\n   - Confirm tool state persistence across server restarts\n   - Validate that single-project usage continues to work as expected",

Design merge logic between context configs and project servers-config.json.\n<info added on 2025-06-27T19:34:20.886Z>\n**File-Based User Configuration System Design:**\n\nContext identification uses project directory path as primary identifier, with optional user_id from .cursor/mcp.json for multi-instance scenarios. Combined context format: '{project_path}' or '{project_path}+{user_id}'.\n\nFile storage utilizes ~/.mcp-bridge-proxy/contexts/ directory with {hash_of_context}.json filenames for filesystem safety. Each context file stores per-context tool enable/disable preferences.\n\nContext file structure includes context_id (hashed identifier), project_path (absolute path), user_id (optional), enabled_tools (hash map by server name), and disabled_tools (hash map by server name).\n\nContext resolution process: extract project_dir from --project-dir argument, extract optional user_id from HTTP headers or startup config, generate context_key combining project_dir and user_id, hash context_key for safe filename, then load or create context file.\n\nIntegration requires merging context preferences with servers-config.json during tool list generation, updating context files on enable_tool/disable_tool operations, and implementing thread-safe file access for concurrent operations.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T19:34:20.886Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-27T19:39:05.258Z>\n**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**\n\nSuccessfully implemented complete file-based user configuration system with context isolation. Created src/context.rs module containing ContextConfig struct with all required fields (context_id, project_path, user_id, client_type, enabled_tools, disabled_tools). Implemented SHA256 hashing for safe filename generation and context file management in ~/.mcp-bridge-proxy/contexts/ directory.\n\nContextManager provides automatic home directory detection, context directory creation, and thread-safe file operations with JSON serialization. Includes context cleanup functionality for inactive contexts older than 30 days.\n\nIntegrated ContextManager into BridgeState with context-aware tool filtering in discover_and_enable_tools function. Modified enable_tool/disable_tool operations to persist preferences to user context files. Tool status reporting now reflects context-specific preferences.\n\nAdded required dependencies: sha2 for context key hashing and dirs for home directory detection.\n\nSystem provides project-based context isolation where different projects maintain separate tool preferences. Tool preferences persist across sessions with graceful fallback to config defaults when no context preference exists.\n\nImplementation ready for testing with current project-based isolation. Next phase requires user_id extraction from HTTP headers for same-project multi-instance support.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T19:39:05.258Z>",

        "details": "This task addresses critical findings from debugging session that revealed tool filtering is completely broken in the multi-project context isolation system. While context loading works correctly (unique context IDs, proper working directory headers, correct context file creation), the tools/list handler ignores context-specific configurations and returns identical tool lists for all projects.\n\n**Core Issues to Fix:**\n\n1. **Tool Filtering Handler Redesign**: \n   - Modify tools/list handler to use context-specific enabled_tools instead of global self.enabled_tools\n   - Implement proper context lookup based on request headers (working directory + optional user_id)\n   - Ensure context-specific enabled/disabled tool states are respected during tool list generation\n\n2. **Architecture Separation**:\n   - Separate system-level configuration (server startup, available servers) from user-level configuration (tool visibility per context)\n   - System config should define which MCP servers to start and make available\n   - User/context config should control which tools are visible/enabled for each project context\n   - Resolve chicken-and-egg problem where current system tries to use user contexts for server startup decisions\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Extract context identification logic into reusable function (project path + user_id hashing)\n   - Modify tools/list endpoint to load context-specific configuration before filtering tools\n   - Update tool filtering logic to check context.enabled_tools map instead of global state\n   - Implement default behavior: start all configured servers but default all tools to disabled state\n   - Add debug logging for context-based tool filtering to verify correct operation\n\n4. **Configuration Structure Changes**:\n   - System config (~/.mcp-bridge-proxy/servers-config.json): defines available MCP servers\n   - Context config (~/.mcp-bridge-proxy/contexts/{hash}.json): stores per-project tool enable/disable state\n   - Ensure context configs are created with all tools disabled by default when new contexts are detected\n\n**Debug Evidence Integration**:\n- Context loading debug logs confirm correct project paths and context ID generation\n- Tool filtering debug logs are missing (code path never reached) - this will be fixed\n- Both projects currently return identical 15-tool lists despite different context configurations",
        "testStrategy": "Comprehensive testing strategy to verify tool filtering fix:\n\n1. **Context Isolation Verification**:\n   - Set up two different projects with different working directories\n   - Configure different tool enable/disable states in each project's context\n   - Verify tools/list returns different tool lists for each project context\n   - Confirm context IDs are correctly generated and used for tool filtering\n\n2. **Tool Filtering Logic Testing**:\n   - Enable specific tools in project A context, disable in project B context\n   - Call tools/list from each project and verify only enabled tools appear\n   - Test edge cases: all tools disabled, all tools enabled, mixed states\n   - Verify global tool list vs context-filtered tool list behavior\n\n3. **Debug Logging Validation**:\n   - Enable debug logging for context-based tool filtering\n   - Verify debug logs appear showing context lookup and tool filtering decisions\n   - Confirm context-specific enabled_tools map is being used instead of global state\n   - Check that working directory headers are properly processed for context identification\n\n4. **Architecture Separation Testing**:\n   - Verify system starts all configured MCP servers regardless of user context states\n   - Test that new contexts default to all tools disabled\n   - Confirm system-level server availability vs user-level tool visibility separation\n   - Test server startup independence from user context configurations\n\n5. **Regression Testing**:\n   - Verify existing functionality still works: enable_tool, disable_tool, save_config\n   - Test that context switching works correctly when changing between projects\n   - Confirm tool state persistence across server restarts\n   - Validate that single-project usage continues to work as expected",
