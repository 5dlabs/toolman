			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement/Fix Configuration Persistence",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by breaking down the implementation of atomic file writing, error handling, validation, backup/rollback, file locking, and integration testing for configuration persistence. Include subtasks for design, implementation, validation, documentation, and stakeholder communication.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing atomic file operations, handling edge cases like failures and concurrency, and ensuring data integrity. It requires careful error handling, validation, and documentation, making it moderately complex. The current subtasks cover the main flow, but additional subtasks for backup/rollback, file locking, and integration with monitoring could further reduce risk and improve reliability."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Fix/Implement MCP Notification System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by detailing subtasks for notification abstraction design, multi-strategy implementation, integration with event hooks, robust error handling, end-to-end UI validation, and cross-client compatibility testing.",
			"reasoning": "Supporting multiple notification strategies, ensuring reliable delivery, and integrating with different UIs adds significant complexity. The need for robust error handling and extensibility increases the cognitive and cyclomatic complexity, warranting a detailed breakdown beyond the current subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AI-Driven Server Addition",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by adding subtasks for AI prompt engineering, API rate limiting, error handling, security review, integration testing, user feedback collection, and rollback mechanisms for failed server additions.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating AI-driven analysis, external APIs, and dynamic configuration generation introduces high complexity due to external dependencies, error handling, and the need for robust validation. Additional subtasks are needed for prompt engineering, security, and user experience validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Configuration Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by including subtasks for configuration schema validation, backup/restore functionality, integration with monitoring/logging, and user documentation updates.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task with moderate complexity, focusing on reliable file I/O and basic error handling. Adding subtasks for schema validation and backup/restore would improve robustness and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Recovery",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by adding subtasks for error logging infrastructure, user-facing error reporting, automated recovery testing, integration with monitoring/alerting, and periodic error review processes.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling and recovery across all core operations is complex, involving middleware, schema standardization, recovery logic, and continuous improvement. More subtasks are needed for logging, monitoring, and automated testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation and Integration Guide Update",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by adding subtasks for documentation style review, translation/localization (if applicable), automated documentation generation, and user feedback collection on documentation usability.",
			"reasoning": "While documentation is less technically complex, ensuring accuracy, completeness, and usability across multiple guides and audiences requires coordination and review. Additional subtasks for style, automation, and feedback would ensure quality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Bulk Tool Management for MCP Bridge Proxy",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by breaking it into subtasks for command parsing, batch operation logic, atomic state management, input validation, preset management, performance optimization, notification integration, and comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing multiple bulk operations, atomicity, extensible presets, and integration with notifications and UI. The breadth and depth of features, along with the need for robust validation and performance, make it highly complex and in need of granular subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Remote MCP Server Support",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by detailing subtasks for protocol abstraction, WebSocket/HTTP client implementation, connection pooling, reconnection logic, service discovery, authentication, TLS integration, error handling, performance optimization, and end-to-end testing.",
			"reasoning": "This is a highly complex task involving network protocol support, security, service discovery, error handling, and performance optimization. Each component is non-trivial and requires dedicated design, implementation, and testing subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Packaging & Distribution System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by breaking it into subtasks for installer development, cross-platform packaging, Homebrew integration, self-extracting binaries, centralized registry setup, version management, CI/CD pipeline, compatibility testing, interactive setup wizard, and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a full packaging and distribution ecosystem across platforms, with automation, registry integration, and upgrade management, is highly complex. Each major component requires focused subtasks for successful delivery."
