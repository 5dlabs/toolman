			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup and build verification process into subtasks such as repository cloning, Rust toolchain installation, build execution, server launch verification, endpoint testing, and documentation of results.",
			"reasoning": "This task is straightforward and procedural, involving standard setup and verification steps with minimal branching or error handling. Complexity is low, but multiple discrete actions justify several subtasks."

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for each core feature to be tested (tool filtering, prefixing, enable/disable, save_config, MCP notifications), UI verification, and documentation of findings.",
			"reasoning": "Requires comprehensive testing and documentation across multiple features, increasing cognitive and organizational complexity. Each feature and UI aspect can be a subtask."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Fix/Implement Tool Filtering and Prefixing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for analyzing current logic, implementing/fixing filtering, implementing/fixing prefixing, updating configuration merge logic, and testing for correctness.",
			"reasoning": "Involves both backend logic changes and UI impact, with potential for subtle bugs in filtering and naming. Requires careful testing and code changes."

			"taskTitle": "Implement/Fix Dynamic Tool Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for endpoint implementation, ephemeral state management, UI update integration, MCP notification handling, testing, and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Requires real-time state management, endpoint work, and UI synchronization, increasing both technical and coordination complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Fix/Implement MCP Notification System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for notification logic implementation, support for multiple strategies, integration with tool management, reliability testing, UI refresh verification, duplicate/missed notification checks, and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Requires cross-component coordination, support for multiple protocols, and robust delivery guarantees, making it technically challenging."

			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AI-Driven Server Addition",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for Anthropic API integration, GitHub CLI integration, README analysis, configuration generation, ephemeral state update, UI verification, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Integrates external APIs, requires AI-driven analysis, and impacts configuration and UI, introducing high technical and integration complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement/Fix Configuration Persistence",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the configuration persistence implementation into subtasks covering: (1) requirements analysis, (2) atomic file writing implementation, (3) error handling and rollback, (4) backup and recovery mechanisms, (5) concurrency and file locking, and (6) documentation and stakeholder communication.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves non-trivial file I/O, atomicity, error handling, and data integrity guarantees, which increases cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. The need for robust failure recovery and backup mechanisms, as well as cross-platform considerations, further raises the complexity. The current subtasks cover the core flow, but additional subtasks for concurrency, rollback, and comprehensive documentation would improve reliability and maintainability[3][5]."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Configuration Management",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: (1) basic file persistence implementation, (2) error handling for file operations, (3) configuration validation and loading, and (4) minimal documentation and user guidance.",
			"reasoning": "This task is focused on basic, reliable file persistence and error handling, with limited scope and no advanced requirements. The cognitive and cyclomatic complexity is moderate, as the logic is straightforward and the subtasks are mostly sequential. One additional subtask for documentation would ensure completeness and usability[3][5]."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Recovery",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: (1) error handling audit, (2) error schema design, (3) centralized middleware implementation, (4) recovery and rollback logic, (5) error message clarity and documentation, (6) monitoring and continuous improvement, and (7) integration and regression testing.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling and recovery across all core operations is inherently complex, involving high cyclomatic complexity, cross-cutting concerns, and the need for robust, consistent error schemas. Monitoring and continuous improvement add ongoing complexity. Additional subtasks for integration testing and regression coverage are recommended to ensure system-wide reliability[3][5]."

			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: (1) gathering updates and team input, (2) updating README/setup instructions, (3) revising integration guide, (4) updating API documentation, (5) peer review and publishing, and (6) documentation usability testing.",
			"reasoning": "While documentation tasks are generally less complex in terms of code, ensuring accuracy, completeness, and usability across multiple documents and audiences adds moderate cognitive complexity. Usability testing and feedback loops are important for high-quality documentation, justifying an extra subtask[3]."

			"reasoning": "This task combines deterministic logic, AI integration, hybrid decision trees, and robust error handling, resulting in very high cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. The need for performance, cost, and security optimization, as well as comprehensive testing, justifies a larger number of subtasks to manage risk and ensure maintainability[3][5]."

			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex, involving multiple protocols, security, service discovery, error handling, and performance optimization. The breadth of features and the need for robust, production-grade distributed system support drive both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity to the highest level. A large number of subtasks is necessary to manage risk and ensure quality[3][5]."

			"reasoning": "Developing a cross-platform packaging and distribution system with registry integration, version management, and CI/CD is highly complex, especially when supporting conversational interfaces and individual tool management. The need for robust automation, testing, and documentation across platforms justifies a high complexity score and a large number of subtasks[3][5]."
